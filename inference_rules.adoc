= MLPerf Inference Rules

Version 0.5 April 16th, 2019

Points of contact: David Kanter (dkanter@gmail.com), Vijay Janapa Reddi
(vjreddi@g.harvard.edu)

== Overview

This document describes how to implement one or more benchmarks in the MLPerf
Inference Suite and how to use those implementations to measure the performance
of an ML system performing inference.

The MLPerf name and logo are trademarks. In order to refer to a result using the
MLPerf name, the result must conform to the letter and spirit of the rules
specified in this document. The MLPerf organization reserves the right to solely
determine if a use of its name or logo is acceptable.

=== Definitions (read this section carefully)

The following definitions are used throughout this document:

A _sample_ is the unit on which inference is run. E.g., an image, or a sentence.

A _query_ is a set of N samples that are issued to an inference system
together. N is a positive integer. For example, a single query contains 8
images.

_Quality_ always refers to a model’s ability to produce “correct” outputs.

A _system under test_ consists of a defined set of hardware and software
resources that will be measured for performance.  The hardware resources may
include processors, accelerators, memories, disks, and interconnect. The
software resources may include an operating system, compilers, libraries, and
drivers that significantly influences the running time of a benchmark.

A _reference implementation_ is a specific implementation of a benchmark
provided by the MLPerf organization.  The reference implementation is the
canonical implementation of a benchmark. All valid submissions of a benchmark
must be *equivalent* to the reference implementation.

A _run_ is a complete execution of a benchmark implementation on a system under
the control of the load generator that consists of completing a set of inference
queries, including data pre- and post-processing, meeting a latency requirement
and a quality requirement in accordance with a scenario.

A _run result_ consists of the scenario-specific metric.

== General rules

The following rules apply to all benchmark implementations.

=== Strive to be fair

Benchmarking should be conducted to measure the framework and system performance
as fairly as possible. Ethics and reputation matter.

=== System and framework must be consistent

The same system and framework must be used for a suite result or set of
benchmark results reported in a single context.

=== System and framework must be available

If you are measuring the performance of a publicly available and widely-used
system or framework, you must use publicly available and widely-used versions of
the system or framework.

If you are measuring the performance of an experimental framework or system, you
must make the system and framework you use available upon demand for
replication.

=== Benchmark implementations must be shared

Source code used for the benchmark implementations must be open-sourced under a
license that permits a commercial entity to freely use the implementation for
benchmarking. The code must be available as long as the results are actively
used.

=== Non-determinism is restricted

The only forms of acceptable non-determinism are:

* Floating point operation order

* Random traversal of the inputs

* Rounding

All random numbers must be based on a fixed random seed and deterministic random
number generator. The fixed random number generator is the Mersenne Twister
19937 generator (std::mt19937). The fixed seed will be announced a week before
the benchmark submission deadline.

=== Benchmark detection is not allowed

The framework and system should not detect and behave differently for
benchmarks.

=== Input-based optimization is not allowed

The implementation should not encode any information about the content of the
input dataset in any form.

=== Replicability is mandatory

Results that cannot be replicated are not valid results.

== Scenarios

In order to enable representative testing of a wide variety of inference
platforms and use cases, MLPerf has defined four different scenarios as
described in the table below.

|===
|Scenario |Query Generation |Duration |Samples/query |Latency Constraint |Tail Latency | Performance Metric
|Single stream |LoadGen sends next query as soon as SUT completes the previous query | 1024 queries and 60 seconds |1 |None |90% | 90%-ile measured latency 
|Multiple stream |LoadGen sends a new query every _latency constraint_ if the SUT has completed the prior query, otherwise the new query is dropped and is counted as one overtime query | 270,336 queries for image models and 90,112 otherwise and 60 seconds |Variable, see metric |Benchmark specific |99% for image models and 97% for otherwise | Maximum number of inferences per query supported
|Server |LoadGen sends new queries to the SUT according to a Poisson distribution |270,336 queries for image models and 90,112 otherwise and 60 seconds |1 |Benchmark specific |99% for image models and 97% for otherwise | Maximum Poisson throughput parameter supported
|Offline |LoadGen sends all queries to the SUT at start | 1 query and 60 seconds | At least 24,576 |None |N/A | Measured throughput
|===

The number of queries is selected to ensure sufficient statistical confidence in
the reported metric. Specifically, the top line in the following table. Lower
lines are being evaluated for future versions of MLPerf Inference (e.g., 95%
tail latency for v0.6 and 99% tail latency for v0.7).

|===
|Tail Latency Percentile |Confidence Interval |Margin-of-Error |Inferences |Rounded Inferences
|90%|99%|0.50%|23,886|3*2^13 = 24,576
|95%|99%|0.25%|50,425|7*2^13 = 57,344
|97%|99%|0.15%|85,811|11*2^13 = 90,112
|99%|99%|0.05%|262,742|33*2^13 = 270,336
|===

A submission may comprise any combination of benchmark and scenario results.

== Benchmarks

The MLPerf organization provides a reference implementation of each benchmark,
which includes the following elements: Code that implements the model in a
framework.  A plain text “README.md” file that describes:

* Problem

** Dataset/Environment

** Publication/Attribution

** Data pre- and post-processing

** Performance, accuracy, and calibration data sets

** Test data traversal order (CHECK)

* Model

** Publication/Attribution

** List of layers

** Weights and biases

* Quality and latency

** Quality target

** Latency target(s)

* Directions

** Steps to configure machine

** Steps to download and verify data

** Steps to run and time

A “download_dataset” script that downloads the accuracy, speed, and calibration
datasets.

A “verify_dataset” script that verifies the dataset against the checksum.

A “run_and_time” script that executes the benchmark and reports the wall-clock
time.

=== Benchmarks

The benchmark suite consists of the benchmarks shown in the following
table. Quality and latency targets are still being finalized.

|===
|Area |Task |Model |Dataset |Quality |Server latency constraint| Multi-Stream latency constraint
|Vision |Image classification |Resnet50-v1.5 |ImageNet (224x224) | 99% of FP32 (76.46%) | 15 ms | 50 ms
|Vision |Image classification |MobileNets-v1 224 |ImageNet  (224x224) | 99% of FP32 (71.68%) | 10 ms | 66 ms
|Vision |Object detection |SSD-ResNet34 |COCO (1200x1200) | 99% of FP32 (0.20 mAP) | 100 ms | 50 ms
|Vision |Object detection |SSD-MobileNets-v1 |COCO (300x300) | 99% of FP32 (0.23 mAP) | 10 ms | 50 ms
|Language |Machine translation |GMNT |WMT16 | 99% of FP32 (23.9 BLEU) | 250 ms | 100 ms
|===

Accuracy results must be reported to five significant figures with round to
even. For example, 98.9995% should be recorded as 99.000%.

== Load Generator

=== LoadGen Operation

The LoadGen is provided in C++ with Python bindings and must be used by all
submissions. The LoadGen is responsible for:

* Generating the queries according to one of the scenarios.

* Tracking the latency of queries.

* Validating the accuracy of the results.

* Computing final metrics.

Latency is defined as the time from LoadGen passing a query to the SUT, to the
time it receives a reply.

* Single-stream: LoadGen measures average latency using a single test run. For
the test run, LoadGen sends an initial query then continually sends the next
query as soon as the previous query is processed.

* Multi-stream: LoadGen determines the maximum supported number of streams using
multiple test runs. Each test run evaluates a specific integer number of
streams. For a specific number of streams, queries are generated with a number
of samples per query equal to the number of streams tested. All samples in a
query will be allocated contiguously in memory. LoadGen will use a binary search
to find a candidate value. It will then verify stability by testing the value 5
times. If one run fails, it will reduce the number of streams by one and then
try again.

* Server: LoadGen determines the system throughput using multiple test
runs. Each test run evaluates a specific throughput value in queries-per-second
(QPS). For a specific throughput value, queries are generated at that QPS using
a Poisson distribution. LoadGen will use a binary search to find a candidate
value. It will then verify stability by testing the value 5 times. If one run
fails, it will reduce the value by a small delta then try again.

* Offline: LoadGen measures throughput using a single test run. For the test
run, LoadGen sends all queries at once.

The run procedure is as follows:

1. LoadGen signals system under test (SUT).

2. SUT starts up and signals readiness. 

3. LoadGen starts clock and begins generating queries.

4. LoadGen stops generating queries as soon as the benchmark-specific minimum
number of queries have been generated and the benchmark specific minimum time
has elapsed.

5. LoadGen waits for all queries to complete, and errors if all queries fail to
complete.

6. LoadGen computes metrics for the run.

The execution of LoadGen is restricted as follows:

* LoadGen must run on the processor that most faithfully simulates queries
  arriving from the most logical source, which is usually the network or an I/O
  device such as a camera. For example, if the most logical source is the
  network and the system is characterized as host - accelerator, then LoadGen
  should run on the host unless the accelerator incorporates a NIC.

* The trace generated by LoadGen must be stored in the non-HBM DRAM that most
  faithfully simulates queries arriving from the most logical source, which is
  usually the network or an I/O device such as a camera. It may be
  pinned. Submitters need prior approval for anything that is not DRAM.

* Caching of any queries, any query parameters, or any intermediate results is
  prohibited.

LoadGen generates queries based on trace. The trace is constructed by uniformly
sampling (with replacement) from a library based on a fixed random seed and
deterministic generator. The trace is usually pre-generated, but may optionally
be incrementally generated if it does not fit in memory. LoadGen validates
accuracy via a separate test run that use each sample in the test library
exactly once but is otherwise identical to the above normal metric run. 

Note: For v0.5, the same code must be run for both the accuracy and performance LoadGen modes.

== Divisions

There are two divisions of the benchmark suite, the Closed division and the Open
division.

=== Closed Division

The Closed division requires using pre-processing, post-processing, and model
that is equivalent to the reference or alternative implementation.  The closed
division allows calibration for quantization and does not allow any retraining.

The unqualified name “MLPerf” must be used when referring to a Closed Division
suite result, e.g. “a MLPerf result of 4.5.”

=== Open Division

The Open division allows using arbitrary pre- or post-processing and model,
including retraining.  The qualified name “MLPerf Open” must be used when
referring to an Open Division suite result, e.g. “a MLPerf Open result of 7.2.”

== Data Sets

For each benchmark, MLPerf will provide pointers to:

* An accuracy data set, to be used to determine whether a submission meets the
  quality target, and used as a validation set

* A speed/performance data set that is a subset of the accuracy data set to be
  used to measure performance

For each benchmark except GNMT, MLPerf will provide pointers to:

* A calibration data set, to be used for quantization (see quantization
  section), that is a small subset of the training data set used to generate the
  weights

Each reference implementation shall include a script to verify the datasets
using a checksum. The dataset must be unchanged at the start of each run.

=== Pre- and post-processing

All imaging benchmarks take uncropped uncompressed bitmap as inputs, NMT takes
text.

Sample-independent pre-processing that matches the reference model is
untimed. However, it must be pre-approved and added to the following list:

* May resize to processed size (e.g. SSD-large)

* May reorder channels / do arbitrary transpositions

* May pad to arbitrary size (don’t be creative)

* May do a single, consistent crop

* Mean subtraction and normalization provided reference model expect those to be
  done

* May convert data among all the whitelisted numerical formats

Any other pre- and post-processing time is included in the wall-clock time for a
run result.

=== Test Data Traversal Order

Test data is determined by the LoadGen. For scenarios where processing multiple
samples can occur (i.e., server, multi-stream, and offline), any ordering is
allowed subject to latency requirements.

== Model

CLOSED: For v0.5, MLPerf provides a reference implementation in a first
framework and an alternative implementation in a second framework in accordance
with the table below.  The benchmark implementation must use a model that is
equivalent to the reference implementation or the alternative implementation, as
defined by the remainder of this section.

|===
|Area |Task |Model |Reference implementation |Alternative implementation
|Vision |Image classification |Resnet50-v1.5 |TensorFlow |PyTorch/ONNX 
|Vision |Image classification |MobileNets-v1 224 |TensorFlow/TensorFlow Lite |PyTorch/ONNX  
|Vision |Object detection |SSD-ResNet34 |PyTorch/ONNX |TensorFlow/TensorFlow Lite 
|Vision |Object detection |SSD-MobileNets-v1 |TensorFlow |PyTorch/ONNX 
|Language |Machine translation |GMNT |TensorFlow |PyTorch/ONNX 
|===

OPEN: The benchmark implementation may use a different model to perform the same
task. Retraining is allowed.

=== Weight Definition and Quantization

CLOSED: MLPerf will provide trained weights and biases in fp32 format for both
the reference and alternative implementations.

MLPerf will provide a calibration data set for all models except
GNMT. Submitters may do arbitrary purely mathematical, reproducible quantization
using only the calibration data and weight and bias tensors from the benchmark
owner provided model to any combination of permissive whitelist numerical format
that achieves the desired quality. The quantization method must be publicly
described at a level where it could be reproduced.  The whitelist currently
includes:

* INT4
* INT8
* INT16
* UINT8
* UINT16
* FP11 (1-bit sign, 5-bit exponent, 5-bit mantissa)
* FP16
* bfloat16
* FP32

August 14, 2019 is the deadline to whitelist a numerical format for MLPerf 0.5.

To be considered principled, the description of the quantization method must be
much much smaller than the non-zero weights it produces.

Calibration is allowed and must only use the calibration data set provided by
the benchmark owner.

Additionally, for image classification using MobileNets-v1 224 and object
detection using SSD-MobileNets-v1, MLPerf will provide a retrained INT8
(asymmetric for TFLite and symmetric for pyTorch/ONNX) model. Model weights and
input activations are scaled per tensor, and must preserve the same shape modulo
padding. Convolution layers are allowed to be in either NCHW or NHWC format.  No
other retraining is allowed.

OPEN: Weights and biases must be initialized to the same values for each run,
any quantization scheme is allowed that achieves the desired quality.

=== Model Equivalence

All implementations are allowed as long as the latency and accuracy bounds are
met and the reference weights are used. Reference weights may be modified
according to the quantization rules.

Examples of legal variance in implementations include, but are not limited to:

* Arbitrary frameworks and runtimes: TensorFlow, TensorFlow-lite, ONNX, PyTorch,
  etc, provided they conform to the rest of the rules

* Running any given control flow or operations on or off an accelerator

* Arbitrary data arrangement

* Different input and in-memory representations of weights

* Variation in matrix-multiplication or convolution algorithm provided the
  algorithm produces asymptotically accurate results when evaluated with
  asymptotic precision

* Mathematically equivalent transformations (e.g. Tanh versus Logistic, ReluX
  versus ReluY, any linear transformation of an activation function)
  
* Approximations (e.g. replacing a transcendental function with a polynomial)

* Processing queries out-of-order within discretion provided by scenario

* Replacing dense operations with mathematically equivalent sparse operations

* Hand picking different numerical precisions for different operations

* Fusing or unfusing operations

* Dynamically switching between one or more batch sizes

* Different implementations based on dynamically determined batch size

* Mixture of experts combining differently quantized weights

* Stochastic quantization algorithms with seeds for reproducibility.

* Reducing ImageNet classifiers with 1001 classes to 1000 classes

* Dead code elimination

For anything else you want on this list contact submitters five weeks prior to
the submission deadline.

Examples of illegal variance in implementations include, but are not limited to:

* Wholesale weight replacement or supplements

* Discarding non-zero weight elements, including pruning

* Caching queries or responses

* Coalescing identical queries

* Modifying weights during the timed portion of an inference run (no online
  learning or related techniques)

* Weight quantization algorithms that are similar in size to the non-zero
  weights they produce

* Hard coding the total number of queries

* Techniques that boost performance for fixed length experiments but are
  inapplicable to long-running services except in the offline scenario

* Using knowledge of the LoadGen implementation to predict upcoming lulls or
  spikes in the server scenario

== FAQ

Q: Do I have to use the reference implementation framework?

A: No, you can use another framework provided that it matches the reference in
the required areas.

Q: Do I have to use the reference implementation scripts?

A: No, you don’t have to use the reference scripts. The reference is there to
settle conformance questions - with a few exceptions, a submission to the closed
division must match what the reference is doing.

Q: Why does a run require so many individual inference queries?

A: The numbers were selected to be sufficiently large to statistically verify
that the system meets the latency requirements.

Q: For my submission, I am going to use a different model format (e.g., ONNX vs
TensorFlow Lite).  Should the conversion routine/script be included in the
submission? Or is it sufficient to submit the converted model?

A: The goal is reproducibility, so you should include the conversion
routine/scripts.

Q: Is it permissible to exceed both the minimum number of queries and minimum time duration in a valid test run?

A: Yes.

=== SSD

Q: Is non-maximal suppression (NMS) timed?

A: Yes. NMS is a per image operation. NMS is used to make sure that in object
detection, a particular object is identified only once. Production systems need
NMS to ensure high-quality inference.

Q: Is COCO eval timed?

A: No. COCO eval compares the proposed boxes and classes in all the images
against ground truth in COCO dataset. COCO eval is not possible in production.

Q: For the server scenario, there are 'Scheduled samples per second', 'Completed samples per second', and the user input QPS. Which one is reported as the final metric?
A: Scheduled samples per second

=== ResNet

Q: The ResNet model returns softmax and argmax, but softmax is never used. Can softmax be dead code eliminated?

A: Yes.

== Appendix Number of Queries

In order to be statistically valid, a certain number of queries are necessary to
verify a given latency-bound performance result. How many queries are necessary?
Every query either meets the latency bound or exceeds the latency bound. The
math for determining the appropriate sample size for a latency bound throughput
experiment is exactly the same as determining the appropriate sample size for an
electoral poll given an infinite electorate. Three variables determine the
sample size: the tail latency percentage, confidence, and margin. Confidence is
the probability that a latency bound is within a particular margin of the
reported result.

A 99% confidence bound was somewhat arbitrarily selected. For systems with noisy
latencies, it is possible to obtain better MLPerf results by cherry picking the
best runs. Approximately 1 in 100 runs will be marginally better. Please don’t
do this. It is very naughty and will make the MLPerf community feel sad.

The margin should be set to a value much less than the difference between the
tail latency percentage and one. Conceptually, the margin ought to be small
compared to the distance between the tail latency percentile and 100%. A margin
of 0.5% was selected. This margin is one twentieth of the difference between the
tail latency percentage and one. In the future, when the tail latency percentage
rises, the margin should fall by a proportional amount. The full equation is:

Margin = (1 - TailLatency) / 20

NumQueries = NormsInv((1 - Confidence) / 2)^2 * (TailLatency)(TailLatency - 1) /
Margin^2

Concretely:

NumQueries = NormsInv((1 - 0.99) / 2)^2 * (0.9)(1 - 0.9) / 0.005^2 =
NormsInv(0.005)^2 * 3600 = (-2.58)^2 * 3,600 = 23,886

To keep the numbers nice, the sample sizes are rounded up. Here is a table
showing proposed sample sizes for subsequent rounds of MLPerf:

|===
|Tail Latency Percentile |Confidence Interval |Margin-of-Error |Inferences |Rounded Inferences
|90%|99%|0.50%|23,886|3*2^13 = 24,576
|95%|99%|0.25%|50,425|7*2^13 = 57,344
|99%|99%|0.05%|262,742|33*2^13 = 270,336
|===

These are mostly for the Server scenario which has tight bounds for tail
latency. The other scenario may continue to use lower samples sizes.
